          <h1>MASTERING A CORPORATE GOTH STYLE</h1>
          <img src="corporate-gothic/corporate2.jpg" alt="" id="i1" />
          <p>
            It’s a classic grown-up goth dilemma - what do you wear to work?
            When your day-to-day style is so gorgeous and full of personality,
            there’s nothing worse than putting on a boring outfit that looks
            like everyone else’s to go to the office. But goths can still look
            professional, and you don’t have to hide who you are at work!
            Mastering a Corporate Goth style will help you feel like yourself
            and look absolutely killer every day. Here’s our top tips for
            putting together the perfect Corporate Goth wardrobe:
          </p>
          <h2>Our favourite colour palette</h2>
          <p>
            Luckily, the generally accepted colour palette for office wear is
            perfect for us alt ghouls! Sticking to black and white looks makes
            it easier to wear pieces that are outside the norm without making
            you stand out *too* much (unless you want to, obviously!). This also
            means you can build a capsule wardrobe where everything matches, so
            you can create new outfits easily, even when you’re half asleep in
            the mornings. Gothic details like spiderwebs and luxurious brocade
            can also be worn subtly if the pattern is black-on-black.
          </p>
          <h2>Spooky accessories</h2>
          <img src="corporate-gothic/corporate4.jpg" alt="" id="i2" />
          <p>
            The best way to ease yourself into a corporate goth look - or to
            keep the darkness more subtle - is with accessories. Necklaces with
            bats, statement rings and creepy earrings will help you feel like
            yourself without going all out. This is perfect if your company has
            a stricter dress code or if you have a specific uniform - there’s
            always room for some ghoulish details! When it comes to bags, go for
            a structured style with plenty of room for all your essentials, but
            make sure there’s a cute little spider or pentagram on there too!
          </p>
          <h2>Super sharp menswear</h2>
          <p>
            If menswear is more your vibe, there’s still loads of easy ways to
            incorporate a darker style. Add interest to work shirts with
            statement buckles or the most adorable moon print, add chains to a
            classic waistcoat and go for smart trousers with added zip details.
            You’ll look hot AF and professional AF at the same time - what a
            dreamboat!
          </p>
          <h2>Make up</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to makeup, it really depends on your company culture.
            We firmly believe everyone should be able to paint their face
            however they want, for everyday life and for work. Unfortunately,
            some employers don’t see it that way and might require you to tone
            it down a bit - boo! Even in those situations, you can usually get
            away with some subtle eyeliner like a small wing, and a deep red
            lipstick will always look sophisticated. If you’re able to do
            whatever you want with your makeup, feel free to go for a smokey eye
            or graphic liner to look like the ghoulish goddess you are! Long
            black stiletto nails may make it harder to type, but the powerful
            feeling they give you makes it totally worth it!

          <h1>Glam Goth Fashion tips</h1>
          <p>
            The key to this look is a mystery, dark colors and a beautiful array
            of laced fabrics and accessories. The Glam Goth look is a
            wonderfully expressive look that is easy to customize and
            personalize, which is probably why it has become so popular in
            recent years. Unlike the classic gothic look, Glam Goth allows girls
            to express not only an alternative personality but their femininity.
            This makes the intriguing world of the gothic instantly accessible
            even for girls who would not associate themselves with the Goth
            culture.
          </p>
          <h2>Makeup</h2>
          <img
            src="fashion/89bed4922cf2678e8ee43d7af430564f.jpg"
            alt=""
            id="i3"
          />
          <p>
            You will need, dark eyeshadow, pale foundations and dark red and
            black lipstick. These can be easily found on RebelsMarket
          </p>
          <h2>Clothing</h2>
          <p>
            The clothing you should include a lot of dark colors and black
            fabrics. You can use black miniskirts, black vest tops as under
            layers and, if you want to add a touch of something special,
            patterned tops and studded black high heels. You can find some
            beautiful classic and modern designs, from laced corsets to
            fashionable hoodies at the RebelMarket, a great online site for
            buying and selling alternative clothing. The key to the Glam Goth
            look is all about elegance, it is important to remember to keep it
            classy. This can be achieved through the use of simplistic clothing
            without patterns or too much color or sparkle. This allows you to
            add your own personality through added accessories without overdoing
            the look.
          </p>
          <p>
            A great outfit could include a short, tight black dress, overlapped
            by a black crop top or vest top and black silver studded shoes. Top
            this outfit off with a silver or black studded belt, studded purse,
            black and silver metal bangles with a matching skull necklace and
            rings. This outfit would be great for going out to a party or club,
            the black and lace is a sophisticated combination.
          </p>
          <h2>Hair</h2>
          <p>
            No look would be complete without the hair and don’t fear there are
            some great ways to achieve an effective hairstyle. If you have long
            hair there is a lot you can do, use a thin comb to backcomb the
            bottom layers of your hair to create volume, and of course, spray to
            keep in place. If you have short hair then you can easily achieve a
            punk-like look that will fit in easily with a Goth Glam style. Spike
            your hair using gel and a good comb, before styling it into place
            with hairspray. The short spiked hair look is a classic look for any
            Goth girl, and can also be used to create a rock look or any
            alternative style as it is versatile and fashionable.
          </p>
          <h2>Attitude</h2>

          <p>
            Additionally, do not forget that the most important addition to your
            Glam Goth look is the attitude. You need to have confidence and
            mystery in order to pull this off, and as long as you feel confident
            and stylish, you will project the style as well as beauty.

          <h1>Casual Goth: How To Get it Right</h1>
          <img
            src="fashion/6acc148e2b758740200ddb83d736e73a.jpg"

          />
          <p>
            For starters, goth is not about everything-black for the sake of it.
            And it’s definitely not about looking scary. The casual goth look is
            about taking inspiration from goth fashion and applying that
            inspiration to create interesting everyday outfits.
          </p>

          <h2>Spikes and Studs Can Work Too</h2>
          <p>
            You don’t have to go full-on goth to get the look. In fact, you
            might be surprised to learn that a lot of casual goths don’t even
            consider themselves goths. But if you’re looking to add a little
            more edge to your outfit, then metal and studs are always a good way
            to do it. Just make sure not to overdo it. A few well-placed pieces
            will suffice. And remember, quality over quantity!
          </p>
          <h2>Distressed Fabrics Are Also an Option</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re not a fan of metal and studs, then distressed fabrics are
            another great way to add some gothic edge to your outfit. Ripped
            jeans, frayed hemlines, and torn t-shirts are all fair game. Just
            make sure that the overall look is still put together. You don’t
            want to look like you just rolled out of bed! So there you have it!
            These are just a few tips on how to get casual goth right. Just
            remember to keep it simple, focus on quality over quantity, and have
            fun with it! Goth should be about self-expression, after all.
