            The horror genre is so prevalent within cinema that the term "horror
            movie" hardly needs a definition. They're movies that are scary.
            They aim to unnerve viewers. But within the horror genre are various
            subgenres, and each tends to have unique ways in which they attempt
            to scare, frighten, and unsettle audiences who feel brave enough to
            sit in the dark and watch them for two hours (on average).
          </p>
          <p>
            Gothic horror is one of the most significant of these horror
            subgenres, and indeed has its roots in literature that existed long
            before film was invented. Gothic horror tends to be rich with
            metaphors, complex villains, and landscapes that are more often than
            not shrouded in darkness and fog. Gothic horror can deal with the
            supernatural, but not exclusively; sometimes, man can be the real
            monster, after all. Gothic horror succeeds in being subtly creepy
            and unsettling, with the following titles exemplifying the subgenre
            well within the medium of cinema.

          <h2>Interview with the vampire (1994)</h2>
          <img src="filme/interview2.jpg" alt="" id="img1" />
          <p>
            Based on the acclaimed 1976 novel of the same name by Anne Rice,
            Interview with the Vampire is one of many notable movies released in
            1994. It's intriguing based on the strength of its cast alone, given
            the two leads here are played by superstars Brad Pitt and Tom
            Cruise, with a strong supporting cast including the likes of Antonio
            Banderas, Kirsten Dunst, and Christian Slater.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the title suggests, a vampire gives a detailed look back at his
            life through an interview, which serves as a framing device and
            allows the film to have a rather epic scope and cover many years. It
            deals with undead characters grappling with the sorts of things
            regular humans do, making it work as both a gothic horror/fantasy
            film and a solidly compelling drama.
          </p>
          <img src="filme/interview3.jpg" alt="" id="img1-1" />

          <p>
            Although one of the characters in "Interview with the Vampire" begs
            to be transformed into a vampire, and eagerly awaits the doom of
            immortality, the movie never makes vampirism look like anything but
            an endless sadness. That is its greatest strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although much has been said about the film's level of violence (and
            although the R rating is quite correct), those who have seen other
            horror films will not be particularly shocked. My complaint about
            the film is that not very much happens, in the plot sense. The movie
            is more about the history and reality of vampirism than about
            specific events, although some action does center around the fate(s)
            of Lestat. A stronger plot engine might have drawn us more quickly
            to the end, but on a scene by scene basis, "Interview with the
            Vampire" is a skillful exercise in macabre imagination.

          <h2>Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)</h2>
          <img src="filme/dracula6.jpg" alt="" id="img2" />
          <p>
            People who know Francis Ford Coppola mostly from movies like
            Apocalypse Now and those in The Godfather trilogy might be surprised
            to learn he made a remarkably good Dracula movie, too. 1992's Bram
            Stoker's Dracula is certainly a good deal racier and gorier than
            most adaptations in the past, like those popular in the 1930s and
            the Hammer Horror ones from the 1950s onwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its inclusion of the author's name in its title promises a more
            faithful adaptation than had been seen previously, and in that
            regard, Bram Stoker's Dracula certainly delivers. It's positively
            dripping with style, atmosphere, and copious amounts of blood, and
            also has a cast to die for, given the actors starring here include
            the likes of Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, and Anthony
            Hopkins.

          <p>
            Anyone who thinks a gothic horror musical about a serial killer
            sounds intriguing ought to check out Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber
            of Fleet Street. It adapts the well-known Stephen Sondheim stage
            musical to the big screen extremely well, and might well be Tim
            Burton's best gothic horror movie (plenty of other films of his have
            a gothic feel, or gothic visuals, but might not be definable as
            full-on horror movies).

          <h2>Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008)</h2>
          <img src="filme/repo.jpg" alt="" id="img4" />
          <p>
            Repo! opens with a comic-book-style prologue that establishes a
            world where organ replacement is the new health norm. But organs are
            expensive, so payment plans have to be signed. And if you fall
            behind, the organ is up for repossession through any means possible.
            Well before Mike Flanagan delivered a dark Big Pharma story in The
            Fall of the House of Usher, Repo did the same with the Largo family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patriarch Rotti Largo (Paul Sorvino) is trying to divide his empire
            among his children: Luigi (Bill Moseley), Pavi (Nivek Ogre), and
            Amber Sweet (Paris Hilton, who “won” a Razzie for her performance).
            Meanwhile, the sickly young Shilo Wallace (Spy Kids’ Alexa PenaVega)
            goes on an adventure to discover the secrets of her past, defying
            the will of her scientist father, Nathan (Anthony Stewart Head).
          </p>
          <img src="filme/repo5.jpg" alt="" id="img4-1" />
          <p>
            Repo is a sung-through musical, meaning every single line of
            dialogue is sung, like in Les Miserables. It adds an
            otherworldliness to the story, allowing your suspension of disbelief
            to go that much further. When every word is sung, you’re willing to
            buy into a world where an overdue heart could be pulled from your
            chest.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the opera elements take the spotlight, this movie is full of
            rock and roll, from Shilo’s black mesh sleeves to a surprise Joan
            Jett cameo. It’s not just for theater kids who have a closet full of
            Rocky Horror costumes; it’s a sicko classic that should stand next
            to The Craft and Corpse Bride in the gothic movie canon. The entire
            movie is filmed with a 2000s’ out-of-focus haziness that makes it
            all feel like a dreamy music video, and the fashions are straight
            out of Hot Topic, but that doesn’t make Repo! any less fun.
          </p>

          <h2>Corpse Bride (2005)</h2>
          <img src="filme/corpsebride.jpg" alt="" id="img5" />
          <p>
            Corpse Bride was dug out of the grave and released to theaters in
            2005. This gothic fairytale follows a young groom-to-be, Victor, as
            he accidentally weds a deceased bride, Emily, and finds himself
            trapped between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead,
            leading to a series of misadventures and unexpected discoveries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corpse Bride is a hauntingly beautiful stop-motion animation by Tim
            Burton. It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost twenty years
            since its release. This film’s signature gothic aesthetic comes to
            life in every frame. In my most recent watch, Corpse Bride falls
            short in terms of character development.
          </p>
          <img src="filme/Corpse-Bride-2005.jpg" alt="" id="img5-1" />
          <p>
            Corpse Bride stands as a testament to Tim Burton's visionary
            approach to storytelling and his ability to create visually
            captivating worlds that resonate with audiences of all ages. For a
            kid's movie, Corpse Bride is very dark. Death is a prominent theme.
            The Land of the Dead is filled to the casket with dark imagery. The
            film could potentially scare young audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not many animated horror films like Corpse Bride exist. The film's
            blend of dark humor, romance, and fantastical elements, combined
            with its exquisite visual artistry and evocative musical score,
            solidifies its place as a beloved classic in the realm of animated
            cinema.

          <h2>Nosferatu (1922)</h2>
          <img src="filme/nosferatu22-2.jpg" alt="" id="img6" />
          <p>
            More than half a century before Werner Herzog tried his hand at
            making a Nosferatu movie, the original one came out and became one
            of the most significant films of the silent era. It was the first
            version of Nosferatu, though of course was itself an unofficial
            adaptation/reinterpretation of Dracula.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, it's done in a way where it's a good deal creepier and more
            successfully horrifying than the (official) Dracula movies that came
            out in its wake. It might have something to do with the lack of
            dialogue; the visuals just feel more impactful and less of this
            world, which naturally bumps up the horror element when the movie in
            question revolves around a menacing and dangerous Count who's also a
            vampire.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>The Phantom of the Opera (1962)</h2>
          <img src="filme/phantom62.jpg" alt="" id="img7" />
          <p>
            This was the third film version made of Gaston Leroux’s The Phantom
            of the Opera (1909). The first and finest version had been the
            silent Universal version The Phantom of the Opera (1925) with Lon
            Chaney [Sr]. The 1925 version has a glorious Gothic feel to it that
            none of the other adaptations ever achieve. Universal had previously
            remade the film in sound and colour as Phantom of the Opera (1943)
            with Claude Rains, although this version lacked the greatness of its
            predecessor. This third version of the story came from England’s
            Hammer Films. (See bottom of the page for the other versions of The
            Phantom of the Opera).
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the Phantom's look, it's fine: his wardrobe is acceptable,
            though I wish he wore his cape more, and I actually like the mask
            quite a bit. I've read it was literally thrown together at the last
            minute and I think that gave it a kind of gritty, grimy look, as if
            this was something he just found lying around and has been wearing
            for many years.

          <h2>Sleepy Hollow (1999)</h2>
          <img src="filme/sleepy-hollow.jpg" alt="" id="img8" />
          <p>
            Sleepy Hollow is based on a short story called The Legend of Sleepy
            Hollow, which was written in 1820, emphasizing how far back in
            history the gothic horror subgenre's roots go. It's set in the town
            of Sleepy Hollow, and follows Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) as he
            investigates a series of gruesome murders there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The killings are thought to have been committed by the Headless
            Horseman, who's a figure from folklore that goes back even earlier
            than 1820; perhaps even to the Middle Ages. In this 1999 adaptation,
            director Tim Burton rides a fine line between keeping things eerily
            old-fashioned yet a little more modern/fresh in other places, thanks
            to the extravagant style and greatly exaggerated violent content.

          <img src="filme/bridefrank_01.jpg" alt="" id="img9" />
          <p>
            No disrespect toward 1931's Frankenstein, but 1935's The Bride of
            Frankenstein is quite possibly the rare sequel that manages to be
            notably better than its predecessor. It reveals the monster survived
            the events of the first film, and is determined to find his creator
            and demand that Dr. Frankenstein makes him a female companion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The famed second monster doesn't appear in the film for very long,
            but she certainly makes an impact and is debatably just as iconic as
            the regular old Frankenstein's monster. The Bride of Frankenstein
            builds on the first film well, and gets the balance between the
            familiar and the fresh just right, all around making for a great
            horror film.

          <img src="filme/crimson-peak-1.jpg" alt="" id="img10" />
          <p>
            Guillermo del Toro is a filmmaker who tends to have unsettling and
            disturbing elements in his movies, even when those movies don't
            specifically belong to the horror genre. As such, when he embraces
            horror wholeheartedly - as he did for 2015's Crimson Peak - the
            results are spectacularly spooky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crimson Peak's a movie that clearly demonstrates del Toro's love for
            this subgenre, with it being distinctly old-fashioned narratively
            and aesthetically, with amazing sets and a story about an unusual
            family and various people with tragic pasts clashing. It's not the
            kind of horror movie that will terrify or traumatize, but it's eerie
            in a kind of (oddly) fun way, and one of the best gothic horror
            throwbacks in recent memory.

          <h2>Van Helsing (2004)</h2>
          <img src="filme/vanhelsing2.jpg" alt="" id="img11" />
          <p>
            Van Helsing is all of the steam punk heroics and CGI action you can
            jab into your jaded eye sockets. Crammed with more villains than a
            gelatinous embryonic sack writhing with vampire progeny, Van Helsing
            gives us the ADHD versions of all of my favourite creatures: the
            Wolf Man, Count Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Van Helsing is the Universal Horror mashup for the youtube
            generation. Here’s the recipe: take all of the legendary Universal
            Monsters, blend them into a chunky batter and then press them into
            eco-green, mega power Nutraloaf energy bars for maximum
            awesomenicity.
          </p>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            The crossover nature of the project was rather ambitious, but it
            doesn’t take full advantage of the two novels it chooses to adapt.
            The Gothic is all about excess and intensity, and those are two
            traits that this movie sorely lacks. Though, credit where credit is
            due, the film’s interpretation of Frankenstein’s monster is much
            closer to how he is in Shelley’s novel compared to most other pop
            culture adaptations of the Gothic classic.
          </p>
          <img src="filme/vanhelsing.jpg" alt="" id="img11-1" />
          <p>
            The film is also sly, and often very funny. Perhaps that's what
            threw so many viewers. They weren't expecting a comedy. There are
            plenty of clues, right from the start. In the thrilling, operatic,
            opening sequence, lovingly-shot in black and white, you have Samuel
            West (as Victor Frankenstein) paying tribute to Colin Clive's
            delirious Henry Frankenstein, while Richard Roxburgh chews the
            scenery as his paymaster, Dracula (it's pronounced Drag-oo-lee-ahh,
            according to the man with the fangs), in a performance that wouldn't
            have seemed out of place in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. If that
            didn't clue you in that you were watching something with its tongue
            decidedly in cheek, I don't know what would! There's no denying that
            the film has many weaknesses: the script is little more than a
            string of set-piece action sequences; there's virtually no character
            development; the dialogue is cheesy; and the performances can
            charitably be described as dubious. Did the film deserve to flounder
            so spectacularly? In truth it's not done too badly. It cost about
            $160m, and took about $120m in the US alone. Add another $25m or so
            from the UK box office, and it doesn't look so disastrous.

          <img src="filme/Picture-of-Dorian-Gray-1945.jpg" alt="" id="img12" />
          <p>
            In 1890, Oscar Wilde penned The Picture of Dorian Gray, which
            centered on a man who was able to stay youthful while his likeness
            in a portrait aged in his place. 55 years later, it got a film
            adaptation that holds up surprisingly well, and is an example of a
            decades-old horror movie that still manages to feel eerie to this
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like all gothic horror should, The Picture of Dorian Gray has a
            tremendous amount of atmosphere, and is also notable for having some
            brief shots in the film memorably appear in color, while the rest of
            it's shot in black and white. It takes the original story and does
            it justice in a new medium, and is itself something of a classic.

          <img src="filme/nosferatu_the_vampyre_79.jpg" alt="" id="img13" />
          <p>
            When Werner Herzog's not making unique and captivating
            documentaries, it turns out he's also capable of making fantastic
            works of fiction. His 1979 film, Nosferatu the Vampyre, is an
            update/remake of an unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula,
            but labeling it as a mere remake would feel unfair, given how much
            Herzog brings to a premise that's, on paper, familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frequent Herzog collaborator Klaus Kinski plays the vampire at the
            center of Nosferatu the Vampyre, and its pitch-perfect casting, with
            it being one of the distinctive actor's best overall performances.
            Isabelle Adjani and Bruno Ganz are also very good, and the film's
            oppressive atmosphere, haunting visuals, and eerie uses of classical
            music also manage to leave quite the impression.

          <img src="filme/eyes.jpg" alt="" id="img14" />
          <p>
            Some squeamish viewers may feel safe going into a horror movie made
            as far back as 1960, because what was shocking back then doesn't
            tend to shock as much nowadays. Yet to such a squeamish viewer's
            surprise (or alarm), Eyes Without a Face - made in 1960 - is still
            able to shock with its violence and horror content all these years
            later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plot is about a doctor pushing medical science to its limits in
            his attempts to perform a face transplant for his daughter, who was
            disfigured as a result of an accident he caused. Once he starts
            really taking things too far, Eyes Without a Face becomes equal
            parts tense and shocking, making this one of the best horror films -
            gothic-infused or otherwise - of its decade.

          <p>
            The 1968's offbeat cult film directed by disgraced director Roman
            Polanski was ranked by Forbes as the second best classic horror of
            all time, right after Hitchcock's Psycho. Mia Farrow stars as
            Rosemary Woodhouse, a young mother who is forced to give birth to
            the son of the devil - after being abused, drugged and tortured by a
            Satanic cult, who will eventually try to steal her baby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mia Farrow impressively illustrates the emotional distress and
            complexity as she is manipulated and abused by her husband Guy -
            played by John Cassavetes - and the rest of the cult, while being
            pregnant. The actress perfectly brings to life the character of an
            isolated woman under constant siege - which is what makes the horror
            movie dreadfully real

          <img src="filme/brides1960.jpg" alt="" id="img16" />
          <p>
            A sumptuous cautionary tale, Brides of Dracula seduces then shocks,
            revealing the rancid dysfunction festering beneath the surface of
            Gothic romanticism. As the title suggests, the film largely focuses
            on women, in particular the grave consequences of
            socially-sanctioned female fantasies. An integral mother-son
            relationship also gives the plot a Freudian depth of depravity and
            enhances its subtle critique of women enabling irredeemable,
            monstrous men.
          </p>
          <img src="filme/brides21960.jpg" alt="" id="img16-1" />
          <p>
            Instead of simply resurrecting Dracula, this enclosed entry in the
            Hammer canon creates a daringly different kind of vampire, a
            disciple of the Count with his own shadowy backstory. As incarnated
            by David Peel, Baron Meinster is a spoiled, manipulative, sexually
            ambiguous rakehell who recognizes and ruthlessly exploits the images
            that women project onto him. He’s the Prince of Darkness in Prince
            Charming’s clothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Brides script went through a long and complicated development,
            yet it manages to clip along at an exciting pace, evoke a sense of
            familial tragedy, and include several memorably unsettling scenes of
            the dead rising and attacking. No small feat!

          <p>
            A classic, vintage horror, another classic from Hammer Horror.
            Expect the usual Hammer attributes, terror, shock, scares, and a lot
            of mesmerism. It doesn't stint on the terror factor here, even now
            it packs a punch, with some sinister concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is "The Devil Rides Out" the best Hammer film this notorious
            production company ever brought forward?? Quite possibly so, as it
            is an almost perfect mixture of allegorical melodrama, compelling
            thriller and occult horror. The screenplay, adapted from a novel by
            horror cinema's most talented writer Richard Matheson, is loaded
            with suspense and atmospheric eeriness and contains an extended
            occult vocabulary that'll make genre fans foam!

          <p>
            If you like period pieces, psychopathic characters, excellent
            actors, and plenty of atmospherics, then "Stonehearst Asylum" should
            be right up your alley. Between its distinctly modern intelligence
            and razor-sharp plotting, Director, Brad Anderson's clever
            contraption almost matches the heights of Gothic grandeur that keep
            Poe held in high esteem even today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jim Sturges plays Edward Newgate, a young psychiatrist who is just
            starting out on his career. He arrives at the isolated Stonehearst
            Asylum, run by the mysterious Dr Silas Lamb. Lamb unorthodox
            practises sit uneasy with Newgate and he soon realises that there’s
            more to the asylum’s history than Lamb is telling him. He befriends
            Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale), a mysterious patient with a painful
            past, who tells Newgate the asylums’s dangerous secret. To say more
            would give away the film’s myriad of plot twists and turns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anderson clearly takes delight in all the proceedings, which is one
            of the reasons the film feels fresh. While the film might lack some
            the macabre drama and dark humor of the original Edgar Allan Poe
            tale, it still does a fine job of conveying a creepy, engaging
            thriller with a brilliant Gothic atmosphere and fine performances
            from its terrific ensemble cast.

          <img src="filme/the hunger.jpg" alt="" id="img19" />
          <p>
            In a bizarre, gory vampire drama starring David Bowie, Susan
            Sanderson, and Catherine Deneuve, John (David Bowie), who is
            battling with the realization that he is not as immortal as he
            imagined, brings Sarah (Susan Sanderson), a gerontologist, home to
            slow down his rapid aging.
          </p>
          <p>
            John is put inside a coffin to lay there eternally and gradually
            dies as the gerontologist transforms into a vampire by his partner,
            Miriam (Catherine Deneuve), and must deal with the fallout. Miriam
            and Sarah start dating physically, revealing a blatant power
            disparity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the novel by Whitley Strieber (also wrote Wolfen and
            Communion), Scott presents us with a story about vampires, although
            not the typical genre picture we might expect. In this film we look
            at vampirism in a more practical, reality-based way; maybe not at
            every moment, but certainly it’s a large and prominent theme.
            Strieber’s main ideas stay in tact, while some is changed to fit the
            mould of what Scott was hoping to accomplish. Mainly, the idea of
            eternal life and eternal youth as two distinctly different things is
            a large part of the screenplay, which also plays into vampirism, in
            this form, as a quest for vanity.
