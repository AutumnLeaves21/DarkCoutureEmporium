            Gothic fashion and culture are hard to narrow down. With so many
            branches and movements within this varied subculture, it seems like
            everyone has a unique take on what they consider gothic fashion.
            However, the million-pound question that everyone wants to know the
            answer to is: where did gothic fashion start? First, to understand
            the roots of gothic fashion, we have to analyse where gothic fashion
            came from by examining the influences which created it. So let’s
            dive into all the things we love about gothic fashion, the
            beautiful, dark, and different origins, by exploring its cultural
            and social history.
          </p>

          <img src="more-subtypes/Theda-bara-hair-.jpg" alt="" id="img1" />
          <p>
            The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same
            era, and has continued to diversify and spread throughout the world.
            Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from
            19th-century Gothic fiction and from horror films. The scene is
            centered on music festivals, nightclubs, and organized meetings,
            especially in Western Europe. The subculture has associated tastes
            in music, aesthetics, and fashion. The music preferred by goths
            includes a number of styles such as gothic rock, death rock, cold
            wave, dark wave, and ethereal wave.[1] The Gothic fashion style
            draws influences from punk, new wave, New Romantic fashion[2] and
            the dressing styles of earlier periods such as the Victorian,
            Edwardian, and Belle Époque eras. The style most often includes dark
            (usually solid black) attire, dark makeup, and black hair.
          </p>
          <h2>Where did gothic fashion originate?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a type of fashion that emerged in the late 18th century and
            caught on due to the Gothic novels of the time. The gothic fashion
            is characterized by black color, gloomy atmosphere, and dark beauty.
            It also includes dark-colored clothing like long coats, skirts or
            dresses with corsets that were popularized by 18th century novelists
            like Byron and Rousseau. Gothic fashion has grown in popularity over
            time even though it was mainly used by men during its early days
            because it was associated with “darkness”. However, now women are
            embracing it because it helps them establish an identity as “dark”
            individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This trend refers to the style of dress and appearance that is
            associated with the goth subculture. This can be seen in music
            videos, movies, and movies. The Goth subculture is very diverse and
            includes many different types of people that have different
            definitions of what it means to be goth. The Goth subculture has
            been around for centuries but it has only recently become popular in
            mainstream culture. It wasn’t until the early 90s when an
            underground scene was able to gain mainstream attention with artists
            like Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails entering mainstream music.
            It is a style of clothing characterized by dark, brooding colors and
            dramatic silhouettes. It is also known as the “vampire” look.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an aesthetic, Gothic Fashion has its origins in the late 18th
            century when it was popular among European gothic literature writers
            to depict the macabre and gruesome. However, it wasn’t until the
            1870s that Gothic Fashion really started to gain popularity. Since
            then, it has continued to be associated with dark aesthetics all
            over the world. Even though Goth fashion has become more mainstream
            over time, it has maintained its dark aesthetic with emphasis on its
            gloomy nature and morbidity.
          </p>
          <img src="victorian-gothic/vic2.jpg" alt="" id="img2" />
          <p>
            Gothic fashion is marked by conspicuously dark, antiquated and
            homogeneous features. It is stereotyped as eerie, mysterious,
            complex and exotic.[61] A dark, sometimes morbid fashion and style
            of dress,[55] typical gothic fashion includes colored black hair and
            black period-styled clothing.[55] Both male and female goths can
            wear dark eyeliner and dark fingernail polish, most especially
            black. Styles are often borrowed from punk fashion and—more
            currently—from the Victorian and Elizabethan periods.[55] It also
            frequently expresses pagan, occult or other religious imagery.[62]
            Gothic fashion and styling may also feature silver jewelry and
            piercings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ted Polhemus described goth fashion as a "profusion of black
            velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple,
            accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious
            stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult
            themes".[63] Of the male "goth look", goth historian Pete Scathe
            draws a distinction between the Sid Vicious archetype of black spiky
            hair and black leather jacket in contrast to the gender ambiguous
            individuals wearing makeup. The first is the early goth gig-going
            look, which was essentially punk, whereas the second evolved into
            the Batcave nightclub look. Early goth gigs were often very hectic
            affairs, and the audience dressed accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We couldn’t write this article about gothic fashion history without
            mentioning the Victorians, their lifestyle and customs. While gothic
            fashion has evolved extensively into modern cybergoth and pastel
            goth, the classic Victorian goth style is still at the heart of the
            movement.
          </p>
          <h2>So what is Victorian gothic fashion?</h2>
          <img src="victorian-gothic/vic7.jpg" alt="" id="img3" />
          <p>
            Essentially gothic mourning attire, Victorian gothic clothing is
            predominantly black but is often accented with dark hues of purple,
            deep reds, or greens. Due to high mortality rates, death was
            ever-present in the Victorian era. Whereas now society tends to view
            death and darkness as ‘taboo’, the Victorians considered these
            elements as being very much a part of their everyday lives and were
            very open about death. Their willingness to confront mortality led
            them to use their clothing to express a state of mourning.
            Everything was black to express the deep sorrow of their loss, then
            as time went on during the ‘half-mourning’ period, the colours
            lightened to grey tones. Men wore black gloves, a dark suit, and if
            they wore a hat, it was notably accessorised with a black band. For
            women, mourning dress was very strict with lots of black, often
            scratchy crape material, and widows often wore a black veil that
            could be changed to white later on. While men were only required to
            wear mourning attire for a few months, women were required to wear
            theirs for two years. Since it was considered bad luck to keep
            mourning clothes in the house after the mourning period had ended,
            they were often disposed of and so it was commonplace for Victorians
            to buy new mourning attire. Since 1994 fans of the Victorian goth
            aesthetic have descended on the North Yorkshire town of Whitby for
            the annual goth weekends which have grown to become one of the
            world’s premier goth events.
          </p>
          <h2>Who created gothic fashion?</h2>
          <p>
            In contrast to the LARP-based Victorian and Elizabethan pomposity of
            the 2000s, the more Romantic side of 1980s trad-goth—mainly
            represented by women—was characterized by new
            wave/post-punk-oriented hairstyles (both long and short, partly
            shaved and teased) and street-compliant clothing, including black
            frill blouses, midi dresses or tea-length skirts, and floral lace
            tights, Dr. Martens, spike heels (pumps), and pointed toe buckle
            boots (winklepickers), sometimes supplemented with accessories such
            as bracelets, chokers and bib necklaces. This style, retroactively
            referred to as Ethergoth, took its inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux
            and mid-1980s musicians from the 4AD roster like Elizabeth Fraser
            and Lisa Gerrard.[64] The New York Times noted: "The costumes and
            ornaments are a glamorous cover for the genre's somber themes. In
            the world of Goth, nature itself lurks as a malign protagonist,
            causing flesh to rot, rivers to flood, monuments to crumble and
            women to turn into slatterns, their hair streaming and lipstick
            askew".[61] Cintra Wilson declares that the origins of the dark
            romantic style are found in the "Victorian cult of mourning".[65]
            Valerie Steele is an expert in the history of the style.[65]
          </p>
          <p>
            There were proponents of the gothic style way before Siouxie Siu,
            Peter Murphy, Bauhaus, and Robert Smith. Plenty of proto-goth style
            icons purposely used the goth aesthetic to make a statement and not
            simply because it was a result of that period’s sartorial
            conventions or social movement. These gothic fashion icons existed
            before the well-known ‘creators’ and deserve a lot more recognition
            for their contributions to gothic fashion and subcultures.

          <h3>Theda Bara</h3>
          <img src="more-subtypes/theda bara.jpg" alt="" id="img4" />
          <p>
            Silent film star Theda Bara can be considered as an OG pioneer of
            gothic fashion and is known as ‘America’s first goth’. Her gothic
            fashion stepped outside traditional 1920s attire with her dark eye
            makeup, revealing yet spooky clothing, and general gothic
            appearance. She was the original Hollywood ‘vamp’ and created the
            vamp and femme fatale stereotype we can recognise today. Even her
            name was explicitly goth: born Theodosia Burr Goodman, the movie
            studio changed her name to Theda Bara; an anagram of ‘Arab death’.
            Her backstory was created to evoke even more mystery and intrigue.
            Publicity for the star mentioned her interest in the occult and
            claimed that she was ‘born in the shadow of the Sphynx’ and
            travelled to Paris to become an actress. In reality, Theda was an
            American born in Ohio, and well, she’d never even visited Paris let
            alone Egypt! She made herself the revealing costumes and wigs for
            her films, most of which were lost thanks to a fire at MGM studios.
            The surviving images of Bara have become iconic and showcase her
            love for long black clothing, revealing outfits, dark eye makeup,
            and an intense look.
          </p>
          <p>
            One female role model is Theda Bara, the 1910s femme fatale known
            for her dark eyeshadow.[49][50] In 1977, Karl Lagerfeld hosted the
            Soirée Moratoire Noir party, specifying "tenue tragique noire
            absolument obligatoire" (black tragic dress absolutely
            required).[51] The event included elements associated with
            leatherman style.[51] Siouxsie Sioux was particularly influential on
            the dress style of the gothic rock scene; Paul Morley of NME
            described Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1980 gig at Futurama:
            "[Siouxsie was] modeling her newest outfit, the one that will
            influence how all the girls dress over the next few months. About
            half the girls at Leeds had used Sioux as a basis for their
            appearance, hair to ankle".[52] Robert Smith,[53] Musidora, Bela
            Lugosi,[54] Bettie Page, Vampira, Morticia Addams,[50] Nico, Rozz
            Williams, David Bowie[55] and Lux Interior[55] are also style icons.
            The 1980s established designers such as Drew Bernstein of Lip
            Service, and the 1990s saw a surge of US-based gothic fashion
            designers, many of whom continue to evolve the style to the present
            day. Style magazines such as Gothic Beauty have given repeat
            features to a select few gothic fashion designers who began their
            labels in the 1990s, such as Kambriel, Rose Mortem, and Tyler Ondine
            of Heavy Red.[56]
          </p>
          <h3>Morticia Addams</h3>
          <img src="more-subtypes/Morticia_Addams_001.jpg" alt="" id="img5" />
          <p>
            Let’s not forget the original Adams Family! Morticia, Gomez,
            Wednesday, Pudsey, Uncle Fester, and co. have been goth since 1938.
            Created by Charles Addams, the world’s first gothic family had a
            profound effect on culture thanks to their attitude, dark humour,
            and wardrobe. However, it was the matriarch of the family, Morticia,
            who inspired goth style with her long black dress, pale skin, black
            hair, and dark lipstick. Not only was Morticia effortlessly elegant
            and always beautifully spooky in the comics, television series, and
            later the movies, she also was the main reason why our next gothic
            fashion icon propelled goth fashion into the mainstream from the
            shadows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morticia Addams (née Frump) is a fictional character from the Addams
            Family multimedia franchise created by American Charles Addams in
            1933. She plays the role of the family's reserved matriarch.
            Morticia Addams has been portrayed by several actresses in various
            Addams Family media, including Carolyn Jones in the television
            series The Addams Family (1964), Anjelica Huston in the feature
            films The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993), and
            Catherine Zeta-Jones in the streaming television series Wednesday
            (2022).
          </p>
          <p>
            Morticia is slim, with extremely pale skin and long flowing straight
            black hair. She commonly wears black hobble dresses to match her
            hair, tightly form fitting, with a fringe of octopus-like cloth
            "tentacles" at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia
            applies baking powder to her face instead of actual makeup. In each
            episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking French (or
            any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically
            inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese shamisen.
            She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she
            discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls
            with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the
            mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions
            for her husband, including eye of newt. Her personal pet is
            Cleopatra, a fictitious breed of carnivorous plant called an African
            Strangler, to which she feeds hamburgers and various other meats.
          </p>
          <h3>Vampira</h3>
          <img src="more-subtypes/vampira-2.jpg" alt="" id="img6" />
          <p>
            Vampira was the original princess of darkness. Born in 1922, Vampira
            was the brainchild of actress Maila Nurmi who created the character
            after seeing Morticia in The Addams Family comics. She hosted a
            late-night horror movie show on the newly born medium of television
            and her blood-curdling scream as she emerged from her coffin bed was
            beamed into the living rooms of thousands of Americans. No one had
            ever seen a human being like Vampira sipping on a ‘vampire cocktail
            garnished with an eyeball’ while bidding goodnight with ‘pleasant
            screams’. She’d introduce each horror film but her personality
            contrasted sharply with her look. She was aloof but friendly,
            sarcastic yet genuine, and her sharp puns were part of her charm.
            Her long dark dresses, heavily corseted waist, sharp eyebrows, and
            long straight black hair made her the antithesis of the popular
            rockabilly look often associated with the 1950s. Nurmi wasn’t just
            Vampira in costume, her interest in alternative subcultures, the
            occult, and all things unique shows that it wasn’t just her love for
            gothic fashion that made her a goth at heart. Vampira’s character
            and style influenced horror movie night host Elvira, who became a
            nineties icon in her own right by combining her Valley Girl schtick,
            wit, and the goth aesthetic.

            A type of goth that focuses on period wear from the Victorian era.
            Similar to Steampunk, a lot of vests, bustles, and bustiers are
            used. These types of goths tend to be more period accurate and many

            Gothic Victorian,a sub-genre of goth or gothic style, flirts with
            the darker side of life. It dwells on tragic romance, the mysteries
            of the human mind, and the fantasy world of nightmares. The most
            mainstream examples can be found in Edgar Allen Poe’s tales, almost
            everything Tim Burton has created over the years, and the unique
            poetry of Emily Dickinson. Everything may seem black, grey, and red
            all over, but Gothic Victorian embraces the beauty of the sad and
            the fun of antique fetishes. It takes inspiration from the Victorian
            period, but doesn’t adhere very strictly to it, mixing in modern
            necklines with puffed crinoline skirts. Not all Gothic Vicotiran
            fashion is dark. Clothing is sometimes white, pink, or soft blue to
            display a ghostly or innocent soul. Gothic Victorian lets you
            explore the two sides of you personality you usually have to hide–
            your romantic side and your wicked side– all while looking amazing!
          </p>

          <p>
            Gothic Victorianism is known for it’s fascination with love and
            death. Victorians had symbols for nearly everything, including
            snakes for eternal love and anchors for loyalty and hope. They also
            had elaborate mourning procedures that involved symbolic items such
            as veils and mourning jewelry. Sentimental and mourning jewelry hold
            a special place in my heart. Pieces are often made from human hair
            woven into brooches, necklaces, bracelets and more. The tradition of
            weaving hair into jewelry began in the 17th century with Stuart
            Crystals and grew throughout the 18th and 19th centuries until the
            Edwardian era. Mementos mori (“Remember your mortality”) have been
            around since ancient times, but became especially popular during the
            15th century. Gothic Victorians still employ updated versions of
            mementos mori, including skulls, angels, crosses, and relics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “gothic” part of Gothic Victorian refers to it’s use of what I
            like to call the “harmonious grotesque.” There’s always something a
            little unsettling about gothic fashion, but that little twinge of
            dystopic strangeness really enhances the allure! I love Gothic
            Victorian style, especially how dark, yet appealing it is. It’s
            perfect for those of us who love being romantic, but can’t stand
            being saccharine. It’s bittersweet and beautiful!

          <h2>STEAMPUNK</h2>
          <img src="steampunk-gothic/steam3.jpg" alt="" id="img9" />
          <p>
            In a broad sense, Steampunk could be called a cultural movement. It
            combines the aesthetics and technology of the 19th century with
            futuristic elements. It is sometimes referred to as science fiction
            from the past or as retrofuturism. Its literary and audiovisual
            works display particular stylistic codes, mixing gears, cogs, and
            other mechanical elements with raw materials like copper, steel, and
            leather. All the technological developments are based on steam
            energy, giving a singular character to these creations. Steampunk
            fans are known to be creative and assertive in their style.
          </p>
          <p>
            This style originated from a sub-genre of science-fiction that
            combines Victorian lifestyle with industrial machinery powered by
            steam. The premise assumes that new energy was never invented and,
            all the Victorian gadgets that were planned to be powered by steam,
            became real life invention.This type of fiction is seen a lot at
            conventions-giving this style a big cosplay base, but many have
            taken it as a personal day-to-day style as well.
          </p>

          <h3>Steampunk, a World of Steam</h3>
          <p>
            Steam is a central element of steampunk. The technology featured in
            this universe is generally just as advanced as that of our modern
            world, but it uses steam as its energy source instead of
            electricity, gas or oil. As a result, steampunk technology takes on
            a retro look reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution era.
          </p>
          <img src="steampunk-gothic/steam2.jpg" alt="" id="img10" />

          <h3>HOW TO ASSOCIATE GOTHIC AND STEAMPUNK?</h3>
          <p>
            Through the definition of Gothic and Steampunk, it is noticed that
            these two genres are different on a number of points. However,
            gothic-style enthusiasts are drawn to Steampunk culture and
            aesthetics. In fact, a great common point unites them: the desire
            for freedom and self-expression. Since the gothic steampunk
            community is quite creative, they do not hesitate to mix the two
            genres by wearing steampunk goth clothing and completing their look
            with steampunk goth accessories.
          </p>
          <h3>STEAMPUNK GOTH CLOTHING FOR MEN AND WOMEN</h3>
          <p>
            The steampunk gothic style is characterized by the use of dark
            colors, including black, brown, or purple. In addition, lace,
            leather, and other materials are the main materials used to design
            outfits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steampunk goth clothing reflects the romanticism and fantasy of the
            Victorian era. If you plan to combine these two genres as a woman,
            you can opt for a vintage Victorian dress in black color or a
            strapless and retro corset.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, steampunk men are increasingly interested in the gothic
            style. If you are going to adopt this style, you can bet on 3-piece
            suits with a dark-colored shirt, a gothic jacket decorated with
            gears, a gothic style coat, a leather jacket, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fashion evolved to include mainly Victorian-style dress overlaid
            with gears, goggles, gadgets, and pouches but, instead of all black,
            this style includes a lot of browns and rich warm colors to
            reference brass, leather, and wood. It has a very utilitarian feel
            while being dressed in refined clothes like long dresses,
            waistcoats, blouses, lace, and tophats.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of the fiction is based around invention and adventure so
            there is also a preoccupation with sea and flying themes. The makeup
            and hair is usually seen to be minimal and reflect the time period
            because the focus is usually on the dress.
          </p>
          <img src="steampunk-gothic/steam4.jpg" alt="" id="img11" />
          <h3>GOTHIC STEAMPUNK ACCESSORIES</h3>
          <p>
            To make your outfit the most complete and in line with the spirit of
            the Steampunk Gothic style, you need to complete it with
            accessories. Gothic steampunk fashion often incorporates large hats
            decorated with feathers. The most characteristic accessories are
            embellished with clock gears and machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite their differences, the gothic and Steampunk genres can be
            combined without any worries. If you want to honor them, just mix
            steampunk and gothic clothes and accessorize them properly. The
            result will be magical!
          </p>
          <p>
            But steampunk also has a wider countercultural presence. Steampunk
            literature has grown so vast that it has developed its own
            subgenres, from alternate histories and social commentary to graphic
            novels and erotica. There are steampunk bands, and steampunk
            conventions draw thousands of people annually to far-flung cultural
            centers such as Atlanta and Seattle, as well as to less likely
            locales such as Bloomington, Indiana, and Lafayette, Louisiana.
            Steampunk also has an international footprint—the French, in
            particular, have a thriving steampunk community, including a theme
            park in Nantes. Steampunk can figure as literary trope, DIY craft,
            or mainstream fashion. Moreover, besides its striking visual
            characteristics, we might also consider steampunk a novel and
            popular way of “doing” history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Defining steampunk is difficult, however, eluding even committed
            practitioners. To some, it is primarily an underground movement,
            perhaps with anarchist leanings (hence, the “punk” in steampunk).
            Detractors often dismiss it as an ephemeral consumer trend.

          <img src="more-subtypes/romantic.jpg" alt="" id="img12" />
          <p>
            This style is very similar to Victorian goth but focuses on the
            Romantic Era instead. The fashion includes a lot of belle sleeves,
            lace, high necks, blouses, and long layered flowy skirts. There is a
            focus on romantic imagery found in poetry such as roses, ravens, the
            color red, architecture, gardens, and cemeteries. This style has a
            focus on art, poetry, solitude and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing inspiration from the late 1800's with references to mourning
            clothing – romantic goth comes as the exact opposite of traditional
            goth, prefering long intricate gowns, coats, velvet and veils to the
            Punk inspired fishnets & studs.11 dec. 2020
          </p>
          <p>
            A popular sub-genre of gothic style, romantic goth takes influence
            from the romantic era of 1800-1850, which embraced imagination,
            feelings and emotion. These qualities made their way into art, music
            and literature, which are key interests of the modern romantic goth.
            This era of romanticism offered an escape from the industrial
            revolution and all the stress and pressure surrounding it. The
            modern romantic goth style really took off in the late 80s and early
            90s. The release of The Addams Family in 1991 had goths fawning over
            witchy matriarch Morticia Addams and her beautiful floor-length
            gown. Plus, the music of the time was heavily romantic
            goth-inspired, with bands like The Cure, Echo & the Bunnymen and
            Depeche Mode in their prime. Today, romantic goth remains popular
            thanks to its timeless appeal and historical influences.

          <p>
            This style became highly popularized in Japan and combines a cute
            lolita style of dress with dark colors and spooky themes. Gothic
            Lolita style works with a lot of doll-like clothing with lots of
            ruffles, puffy sleeves, and gathers. Aprons, gloves and stockings
            are added to give a refined but cute look.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common motifs in Gothic Lolita often include crosses or religious
            themes, bats, skulls, coffins, chandeliers, deep red roses, and
            castles. Darker colors, such as black, navy and royal blue, maroon,
            crimson, and deep purples are all common in Gothic Lolita. Black and
            white color combinations are somewhat taboo, but can be and have

            goth. Yet, plenty of people nowadays don’t know what “trad goth”
            actually means. And with so much chitter-chatter about this variant
            on social media, it makes the issue that much more confusing. If

          <p>
            Traditional Goth or Old-School Goth are popular names for the first
            wave of the gothic subculture that emerged in the UK in the late
            1970s and early 1980s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also known as “traditional goth”, this style refers to the original
            80s goths and how they pioneered the gothic. The fashion typically
            included very dramatic black and white makeup that extends upward
            toward the temple, teased long hair- sometimes in a mullet, and
            layered dark clothing that is usually pretty covering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Horror movies, books, and music served as inspiration, and their
            gloomy style still impacts the subculture today. Traditional goth
            music is distinguished by its atmospheric, melancholy sound, which
            often uses synthesizers and drum machines extensively.

          <p>
            In contrast, traditional goth attire is mostly black, with romantic
            and Victorian-inspired elements like ruffled dresses, corsets, long
            flowing gowns, lace, and leather. A prevalent trait is also a lot of
            black makeup.
          </p>

            Traditional goths often have interests in poetry, art, literature,
            clothing, and music, such as works by H.P. Lovecraft, Anne Rice, and
            Edgar Allan Poe. They enjoy debating philosophical issues like the

            There comes a time in every goth’s life when they grow up and have
            to go out and do the “adult thing” - you know, like getting a job to
            pay for the bills. Does that mean you have to swap your skulls and

          <p>
            Corporate goth is precisely how it sounds - business attire with a
            dark, gothic twist. It’s meant for older goths who have to join the
            workforce but don’t want to give up their alt aesthetic. After all,
            for hardcore goths, it’s not a “phase” - it’s a lifestyle. And just
            because you have a job doesn’t mean you have to fall in line and
            give up your unique appearance and love of the morbid.

            It can be hard to picture what a corporate goth might wear. After

            in skimpy and/or creepy clothing items - not exactly the clothing
            labeled as “office wear.” But the right get-up can be the perfect
            blend of macabre and professional. You just have to utilize some of
            these items:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Black Blazer</li>
            <li>
              Black Skirts - For more lax environments, don’t hesitate to throw
              on a plaid skirt. It offers a bit more edginess than a plain black
              skirt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dresses and Tights - You can stick to wearing more basic,
              corporate-friendly black dresses if you prefer. Or, you can add
              some uniqueness and personality to your wardrobe with a black
              striped dress.
            </li>
            <img src="corporate-gothic/corporate3.jpg" alt="" id="img17-1" />
            <li>
              Pants - Pants with a pinch of lacy detailing are a great choice
              too. This is an excellent way to show off your goth vibes without
              being too noticeable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Classy Shirts - Many “gothic” elements are suitable for the
              office. For example, Victorian-era clothing items are professional
              and elegant, perfect for corporate offices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stripes - Many goths, including corp goths, prefer to keep their
              clothing black from head to toe. And that’s perfectly fine! But
              for those days when you want to break up the monotony, stripes are
              an excellent way to go.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessories - Whether it’s a handbag, cross choker, or bat
              earrings, accessories allow you to add more gothic personality to
              your style without going overboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Footwear - Corp goths almost always reach for black boots for the
              simple fact that they’re somewhat professional yet still on the
              gothic spectrum. A set of stylish chunky heels can also do the
              trick!
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Corporate Goth isn’t just about the way you look - why not create a
            spooky environment for yourself too so you feel more at home?
            Decorate your desk with a crystal ball, Skull Planter or a catch-all
            dish for your nick-nacks. Stay caffeinated with your favourite
            spooky mug, or go the hydrated route with a badass cold brew cup. We
            also love to keep some crystals on our desks at KILLSTAR HQ -
            Obsidian is great for protection and absorbing negative energies
            from any Karens you work with, while Tiger’s Eye helps you focus all
            day long.

          <h2>CYBERGOTH</h2>
          <img src="cyber-gothic/cyber2.jpg" alt="" id="img18" />
          <p>
            This style is closest to cyberpunk but whereas cyberpunk is mainly
            applied to cosplay and science fiction, cyber goth is mainly applied
            to an industrial rave-type music scene. The fashion is somewhat
            similar and also features bright neon colors paired with black and
            uses technological themes such as cyborgs and circuit boards as well
            as a focus on toxic waste and poison.
          </p>

          <p>
            A defining difference, however, is that cyberlocks are popularized
            in this subgenre which are a type of plastic dreadlock and also more
            ravewear/ festival clothing is used (fuzzy legwarmers, stand alone
            hoods, miniskirt tutus, light-up accessories etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The cybergoth style didn't appear until the 90's and made a
            significant impact with it's mix of black & neon colors ! This form
            of Goth referes to a high-tech, post-apocalyptic future. Think
            LED's, cybernetics, respirators... The biohazard symbol is highly
            featured in this substyle so behind a very rave-y style might lie a
            form of social commentary about technology and it's hasards ?
            Googles, platform boots, vinyl and hairpieces of dreads and tubing
            are a staple in this style on men and women alike. Usually a
            cybergoth outfit consists of all black clothing with one bright
            accent color. The industrial substyle has similar codes but takes a
            more pessimistic outlook on the futurist inspiration – it takes a
            more distopian turn as we'll frequently see elements taken from the
            military wardrobe, from combat boots to cargo pants.

          <h2>GOTHABILLY/ PIN-UP GOTH</h2>
          <img src="more-subtypes/gothabilly2.jpg" alt="" id="img19" />
          <p>
            This is a type of goth that combines 50s-type dress- calf length
            dresses with long petticoats, halter tops, and high waisted bottoms
            with dark colors and retro creepy prints. Many maintain a more
            simplistic look with retro makeup and hair and will opt for a kitten
            heel or pumps instead of a chunky goth boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Motifs ordinarily seen in Gothabilly fashion are cherries, dice and
            playing cards, flames, animal prints, tattoo-inspired designs, polka
            dots, sugar skulls, swallows, zombies and pin-up girls (or simply
            zombie pin-up girls) – retro and kitsch with an added dark twist.
            For men and women tattoos are often common, featuring pin-up girls,
            flaming skulls and playing cards. Gothabilly women could be
            described as “Living Dead Dolls” and can often be seen in pencil
            skirts, heels, red lipstick and seamed fishnet stockings; hair may
            be styled with victory rolls, quiffs and Bettie bangs – the entire
            appearance, for women, could be summed up with “Morticia Addams
            meets Bettie Page.” Gothabilly males may sport creeper shoes, cowboy
            boots and hats, morning coats and dusters. Fashion influences
            include The Cramps themselves, Fields of the Nephilim (a 1980s Goth
            band famous for their dusty cowboy gear) and The Gothic Cowboys.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gothabilly fashion consolidates more colour than many styles of Goth
            fashion that are frequently black and white-oriented, sometimes with
            hints of red and grey – from brightly coloured leopard print to red
            or pink 1950s cardigans. It can also be a more masculine look for
            the males – as opposed to the frilly shirts of romantic goth or the
            ripped tights sported in deathrock. As Voltaire points out in What
            Is Goth?, Gothabilly is a good look for darkly-inclined gentlemen
            who do not wish to dress like “fruity vampires.” Shirts with the
            sleeves ripped off, black denim, tattoos of buxom women and
            rockabilly quiffs galore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gothabilly interests include hot rods and hearses, horror B-movies
            and vintage fashion. Gothabilly incorporates that tongue-in-cheek
            humour found in the music – Auxiliary Magazine says, “Whether it is
            putting mini top hats on taxidermy bats or planning a creepy tiki
            party, it is all about dark humoured fun.” The music blaring from a
            Gothabilly’s headphones is likely to include bands such as those
            named above, as well as Cult of the Psychic Fetus, Vampire Beach
            Babes, The Horrorpops, The Phantom Cowboys, Zombie Ghost Train,
            Ghoultown, Dead Sea Surfers, The Coffinshakers, Pink Hearse, and the
            Surf Sluts.

          <img src="more-subtypes/cabaret.jpg" alt="" id="img20" />
          <p>
            This is an offshoot of victorian goth that goes for a more
            theatrical stage look- sometimes verging on carnival. There is more
            of a focus on lingerie, pinned up high-low shirts, corsets, silk and
            robes. This style tends to be more provocative and sensual than
            normal Victorian goth. ‍
          </p>
          <p>
            Cabaret Goth is similar to Steampunk in that it is another subtype
            that combines modern looks with those of an older style. Cabaret
            Goth is also known as “Burlesque Goth,” as it takes strong
            influences from vaudeville performances. Members of this subtype
            want to be both sexually attractive but still very tasteful in their
            appearances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their attire has a 50s vibe to it, though with darker colors.
            Fishnet and plumes are a must for the ladies, while suspenders and
            fedoras are a must for the men (“Different”). Once again, this
            subtype is not linked with a specific type of music, though one
            could argue that they may enjoy 1950s-styled music.

          <p>
            Unlike other substyles, this type of goth developed from a belief
            system that revolves around astrology and magic/witchcraft. This can
            also include voodoo and other tribal/ indigenous goths who focus on
            shamanism and the spirit. The fashion for this can differ in amount
            of decoration but always follows witchy and celestial themes. There
            tends to be a lot of wide-brimmed hats, bell sleeves, sigils drawn
            on the skin, forehead decoration, crystal jewelry, scarves, and
            veils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously, to dress like a witch, the first thing you’ll want to
            consider is whether your clothes give off a magickal feeling! Do
            they feel powerful, mystical, and romantic to you? Maybe it’s the
            way the fabric flows off your body, maybe it’s how the colors pop,
            or maybe it’s got a shimmer to it…Whatever it is, the clothes you’ll
            want to wear will make you feel like you’re glowing from the inside
            out! From the deep colors to the soft, romantic fabrics, to the
            carefree silhouettes…This dark but fairytale-esque aesthetic is core
            to creating a witchy style. It will empower you to embrace all
            aspects of yourself–including the parts you tend to hide in the
            dark. Whether you’re spending your time brewing up potions,
            strengthening yourself with your crystals, seeking wisdom from your
            tarot cards, or just enjoying some time out in nature…A witchy
            outfit is bound to make you feel strong and enlightened to the
            little bits of magick found in simple day-to-day moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fashion style is powerful, magical, dark, and dramatic.
            Inspired by witches, both real and from fairytales. For fierce and
            romantic individuals with great curiosity, serenity, love for
            nature, and humble understanding of their strengths and weaknesses

          <img src="more-subtypes/fetish.jpg" alt="" id="img22" />
          <p>
            This style is where goth meets BDSM culture. The fashion includes a
            lot of leather, latex, corseting and collars, however, it does not
            necessarily have to be sexual. A lot of these can be worn for just
            aesthetic reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no specific music genres that appeal to the entire type,
            but generally anything fetish related is something they might like.
            (And there are many bands that write fairly interesting songs.) It's
            known that industrial and 80's new wave might be a little more kinky
            than other types of music. The Goth subculture isn't one to
            discriminate others' expressing of sexuality, so many times, there
            are events that will appeal to all types, including Fetish Goths.
            There may be a specific night dedicated to them at Goth clubs, as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fetish subculture was always very close to the to the Goth
            movement, but some people like to step it up a notch. This substyle
            of Goth came about by people who liked wearing more leather, PVC and
            BDSM themed clothes. Fetish Goths will enjoy big boots & heels,
            tight vynil or leather clothing such as skin-tight pants and
            corsets. Chokers are a staple for the perfect Fetish Goth outfit.
            However – don't be mistaken. Fetish Goths might not be that freaky
            in the bedroom... it could just be an aesthetic they enjoy, so hands
            off !

          <img src="more-subtypes/medieval.jpg" alt="" id="img23" />
          <p>
            This is a type of goth that involves medieval and historical imagery
            like churches, castles, crosses, mythology, dragons, magic etc. The
            fashion will usually combine long skirts, corsets, blouses with dark
            aesthetics. Fairy Goth is a subset of this that will take a
            whimsical, magic, fantasy approach to this and Vampire Goth will
            take a sleeker, sexier, more refined look- usually focused on cursed
            and holy imagery. Creature aesthetics can also be added to this
            style such as elf or goblin ears, horns, wings, or tails to mirror
            the mythological fascination.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medieval goth style is a distinctive mix of gloomy, brooding
            aesthetics and historical elements inspired by the Dark Ages. Dark,
            textured fabrics like velvet, lace, and leather are usually used
            when dressing in medieval gothic style. Corsets, tunics, capes, and
            long, flowing gowns and robes are examples of clothing styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aesthetic often includes chokers, crowns, extravagant jewelry,
            and elaborate headpieces. Focusing on dark and romantic themes like
            vampires, witches, and medieval mythology, this fashion sometimes
            combines parts of Victorian or Edwardian designs with
            medieval-inspired clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like Victorian fashions inspire the Victorian Goths, the
            Medival fashions do the same for the Medival Goths. There's more
            than just an 80's music and fashion when it comes to the start of
            Goth; it goes to the time of medival cathedrals whose architecture
            was dubbed as "Gothic". For this reason, it's no wonder that many
            Goths enjoy the medival aesthetics, both in fashion and in
            buildings. This type generally loves the old tales of dungeons and
            dragons, knights and wizards, and loves the old buildings, lore, and
            history of the medival times. Renaissance fairs are a place where
            these Goths can be as elaborate with their clothes as they want, a
            perfect place for them to run wild. These Goths aren't limited to
            only medival clothes, typically blending in elements of Celtic
            origin and other old civilizations as well. Folk music and metal
            like Korpiklaani may be right up their alley, along with old chants
            and songs.

          <img src="more-subtypes/glam.jpg" alt="" id="img24" />
          <p>
            This subset takes inspiration from glam rock- people like David
            Bowie- with deep v-necks, teased hair, feathers, leather and fur. It
            has a more theatrical costume type of feel similar to the characters
            in Rocky Horror Story. Animal prints, sequins, and colored leather
            were all deviations from average goth styles, but used in this one
            to enhance dramatic flair.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to this look is a mystery, dark colors and a beautiful array
            of laced fabrics and accessories. The Glam Goth look is a
            wonderfully expressive look that is easy to customize and
            personalize, which is probably why it has become so popular in
            recent years. Unlike the classic gothic look, Glam Goth allows girls
            to express not only an alternative personality but their femininity.
            This makes the intriguing world of the gothic instantly accessible
            even for girls who would not associate themselves with the Goth
            culture.

            This is a newer genre of goth dress that uses black and dark colored
            versions of everyday-styled dress. It is a more casual and sleek
            version of goth that is inspired by a lot of anti-fashion and is
            less overstated and decorated compared to most other goth styles.
            Even though there is a more minimal and modern edge to this goth,
            most of the clothing still plays homage to older goth interests and
            traditions- including lots of occult and celestial themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s rooted in and influenced by Trad Goth to a degree, but some in
            Nu-Goth style do consider certain musical genres to be Goth which
            have very little connection to what is accepted as
            Post-Punk-originating. Despite this, many other Nu-Goths do enjoy
            originating Goth music. For this reason, they are not discounted
            from the scene by Trad Goths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides music, they are very different in their visual aesthetics
            than most Batcaver/Trad Goth types. Batcaver/Trad Goth is visually
            very broad, taking inspiration from all forms of mythology, Catholic
            imagery, and Gothic types of poetry, literature, and film. Nu-Goth
            imagery and fashion focuses far more heavily on the romanticization
            of witches, paganism, and the occult (even in comparison to the
            equally influenced Deathrock and Hippie Goth). This mix of sleek,
            modern clothes with witch/pagan images visually gives them more in
            common with Pastel Goth.

          <p>
            Nu-Goths are known to welcome Baby Bats & Mall Goths to their
            subculture and are more lenient on the music knowledge compared to
            their Trad Goth counterparts. As previously stated, many Nu-Goths
            (but not all) believe the visual/fashion characteristics of Goth are
            more important than the music genre. Interestingly, while there is a
            clear stylistic difference between the two, Trad Goth fashion as it
            began in the 80s was extremely broad and undefined. Therefore, there
            is no reason that someone could not be Trad Goth and Nu-Goth at the
            same time or why they could not mix visual influences.

          <h2>DEATHROCK</h2>
          <img src="more-subtypes/deathrock.jpg" alt="" id="img26" />
          <p>
            This goth aesthetic is a combination of punk and goth styles.
            Deahrockers are typically more made-up punks that dress in mainly
            black and wear makeup similar to trad goths. This style is
            hallmarked by shaved heads, ripped clothing, mohawks, fishnets and
            lots of DIY clothing with spooky aesthetics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deathrocker goths are often seen as the missing link between goth
            and punk since they are more closely tied to traditional goths than
            any other subgroup.
          </p>
          <p>
            True Deathrock music is known for having a more loud, punk-like
            sound incorporated with a more theatrical presentation (compared to
            post-Batcave Goth) and lyrics often referencing horror movies and
            other sci-fi themes. Some of it even crosses into Rockabilly or
            Psychobilly, such as The Birthday Party, The Gun Club, and
            especially The Cramps. Horror Punk is also beloved by many in the
            scene (particularly The Misfits).

          <h2>Metalhead</h2>
          <img src="more-subtypes/metalhead.jpg" alt="" id="img27" />
          <p>
            Another variation includes the “Metalhead”; some debate on whether
            or not they are truly Goth, as they did with the Marilyn Manson
            controversies. However, Metalheads do have enough similarities with
            other Goth subtypes to be considered Goth themselves, at least in
            this thesis. They adore all types of metal music, especially dark
            metal and symphonic metal, as they generally fit more with Goth
            interests. Dark leather seems to make up much of their wardrobe,
            along with other “spooky” accessories. Metalheads can be compared to
            “Deathrockers,” which are Goths who take more from Punk than Goth as
            far as music goes, but aesthetically fit in more with the Goth
            subculture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Metalheads, Deathrockers are extremely passionate about their
            music, which contains darker twists of Punk music without the gentle
            twist on the music itself, which first-wave Goths enjoyed. Harder
            80s Goth rock as well as more modern Punk rock, Horrorpunk and
            Psychobilly are favorites of Deathrockers.

          <h3>CASUAL GOTH</h3>
          <img src="more-subtypes/casual.jpg" alt="" id="img28" />
          <p>
            They are less flashy and showy with their attire, and many Goths
            revert to this type when staying home or simply are not up to
            spending over an hour on their appearance before going out. Despite
            the fact that they are dressing down, they still stick to mostly
            dark colors, and other aspects of their appearance can still help
            identify them as Goth: dyed and/or teased hair, piercings and
            tattoos are some such aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            They may also wear Goth band t-shirts and may include accessories
            from their more eccentric outfits (Balanck). A Casual Goth
            appearance is very convenient for running errands or going to school
            or work, in order to save time in the morning and not be a
            distraction to your classmates or coworkers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Casual goth is, as the name suggests, a more casual take on
            traditional gothic fashion. Despite the preconceptions you might
            have, it’s perfect for everyday wear, and it allows you to
            incorporate gothic style into your look without going full-on dark
            mode. Casual goth is all about simplicity and elegance. The key to
            nailing the look is to focus on quality over quantity. A few
            well-chosen pieces will go a lot further than a bunch of cheap tat
            from the local Halloween store. One of the great things about casual
            goth is that it can be as dressy or as casual as you want it to be.
            It’s perfect for everything from a day at work to a night out on the
            town.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you walk away from this with one lesson, it should be that the
            goth style doesn’t mean committing fully to black for the sake of
            it. Casual goth is a great style for anyone who wants to add a touch
            of darkness to their wardrobe. It’s also perfect for people who want
            to experiment with different styles without going too crazy. So,
            give it a try. Maybe a little black is exactly what’s been missing
            in your life.

          <h2>MALL GOTH</h2>
          <img src="more-subtypes/mall.jpg" alt="" id="img29" />
          <p>
            These types of goths were seen in the early 2000s as posers who only
            listened to nu-metal and only copied goth fashion. They would hang
            around at malls- especially in front of stores like Hot Topic and
            are the closest to emo styles. The fashion is reminiscent of early
            2000s style but with a darker punkier twist- similar to that of
            Avril Lavigne. A lot of low-waisted bottoms, miniskirts, colored
            plaid, arm warmers, and cargo pants were used and paired with
            characters like Hello Kitty or other Sanrio characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Mall goth" is derived from the words "mall" and "goth", referencing
            how many participants of the subculture would often spend time at
            shopping malls. In particular, it often references their buying of
            items from Hot Topic. The term began as pejorative, connoting solely
            being interested in goth for its fashion, rather than the subculture
            itself, similar to the use of poseur. Marilyn Manson and Amy Lee
            were influential upon the culture's development. According to
            Adolescent writer Angelina Zaphyria, it began as a fusion of the
            cultures of the existing goth, third wave emo and nu metal
            movements, however according to Fashion writer Isabel Slone, it
            "combined the hallmarks of punk, goth and metal subcultures".

          <h2>PASTEL GOTH</h2>
          <img src="more-subtypes/pastel.jpg" alt="" id="img30" />
          <p>
            Pastel Goth is strikingly different from other forms of Goth in that
            their favorite color is not black, but rather bright and light
            colors like pastel pinks and purples. They take elements from metal
            and death rock scenes such as pentagrams, inverted crosses, skulls
            and spikes, but then combine them with flowers and bright colors.
            They have been described as “sickeningly sweet” or “creepy-cute.”
            They have an appreciation for retro and 80s Goth music, along with
            more modern bands that have mixed cuteness in with their creepiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‍ Completely different from anything else on this list, pastel goth
            combines gothic styles of dress but instead pairs them with very
            bright and pastel colors. This style is sometimes characterized with
            overdecoration as it relies a lot on heavy accessories including
            colors, beaded bracelets, and plastic hair clips. There can also be
            babydoll, cartoon or other child-like themes. Sometimes this style
            bleeds over into lolita and has a lot of influence in Japan.

          <p>
            The Goth Scene Today and Its Impact on the Fashion Industry Goth is
            a subculture with its own fashion, music, and lifestyle trends. The
            scene has been around since the late 1800s, but it was not until the
            1990s that it became popular in mainstream culture. It was around
            this time that many fashion brands started to use Goth imagery in
            their marketing campaigns. The popularity of Gothic fashion has led
            to various other fashion labels following suit. However, while some
            designers borrow from Goth style for inspiration, others find ways
            to incorporate these elements into their own designs that are more
            accessible to broader audiences. For instance, brands like Dolce &
            Gabbana started using Gothic-inspired makeup products even though
            they are mainly focused on high fashion clothing production. The
            Goth subculture has been around for centuries. After it first
            emerged in England, the Goth subculture soon became more mainstream.
            This article will explore how the Goth subculture impacted fashion
            and its continued impact on society today. It’s hard to imagine that
            the Goth subculture has only been around for a little over 30 years.
            The subculture is still going strong, with its own fashion and music
            scene. The popularity of the subculture has also impacted the world
            of fashion at large, with many designers looking for inspiration
            from Gothic artists and style icons.

            Goth is a subculture, fashion style, and musical genre which emerged
            in England during the early 1980s. It began when members of the
            English post-punk movement began to dress and behave like their
            favorite horror movie characters. The clothing styles and music of
            the gothic bands helped define this look for people who were looking
            to express themselves outside of their everyday identities. The Goth
            Scene today has evolved to be much different than it was back in the
            80’s. It has shifted to a much more mainstream fashion scene, which
            has contributed to the decline of the Gothic subculture. Many people
            are worried that Gothic culture will not survive due to its
            declining popularity. This is because many of the subculture’s
            values are no longer prevalent, such as tattooing and piercings.
            However, many goth children now see themselves as individuals who
            are not limited by these values and are embracing these new ideas
            that were once considered too mainstream for them to wear or
            experience.
